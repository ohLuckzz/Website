    title: `Element 1 - Developmental Philosophy`,
    firstParagraph: `Our developmental philosophy guides all elements of our program
        design and focuses on two core areas of player development: Character Development and
        Athlete Development.`,
    secondParagraph: (
      <span>
        <i>Character Development</i> is our first priority. Our focus is on
        helping each player learn what it means to be a good teammate. We want to help each child transition from a “me” centered world
        view to a “we” one. We are laser focused on developing great
        sportsmanship, where each player learns to win and lose with grace. We
        want our players to learn how to deal with frustration and struggle in
        productive ways, realizing it is an inevitable part of any journey worth
        taking. We emphasize effort and attitude always, and help each child
        connect the dots between disciplined practice and in game performance.
        How they spend their time today impacts what they can do tomorrow, we
        want the kids to develop that understanding and begin taking ownership
        of their development. It is these values and more that will equip each
        child with the tools they need to go on to live healthy and productive
        lives. That is our main goal.
      </span>
    ),
    thirdParagraph: (
      <span>
        <i>Athlete Development</i> matters a lot too. We understand the chance
        that any kid plays competitive sports beyond high school is slim, but we
        start from the assumption that it is entirely possible if it happens to
        be a child’s dream. Our role is in helping kids discern their dreams,
        then helping them build the skills to chase them.
        From an athlete development perspective, we focus on the following:

      `It must be fun! – Kids want to play youth sports because they
        are fun and they get to spend time with their friends. They quit
        when they stop having fun…period. We can’t ever lose sight of
        that.`,
      `It’s not all fun! – We help them
        understand how there can be different types of fun, and
        sometimes you need to endure some discomfort in the short-term
        to have fun in the long-term.`,
      `Practice design – We take practice design seriously. We are
        constantly learning and studying to get better. We seek to maximize
        reps through efficient design, small groups, and station
        rotation. Kids want to move, they want high energy, our
        practices should be that. Kids love games and they love to
        compete; our practices should have a lot of both.`,
      `Continous learning – We are not professional coaches, but we constantly
        seek insight from baseball professionals to help us get better.`,
      `Cross train – We are strong advocates that kids should play a
        lot of different sports. They build more
        balanced bodies, more well-rounded athleticism, it keeps things
        interesting, and they interact with more kids. Our program
        should never stifle that, but always encourage it. In addition
        to building sport specific skills, we also emphasize developing
        in non-sport specific ways…speed, strength, and agility.`,
      `Cultivate desire - It’s hard to tell if any child has the
        physical tools to compete at high levels until around 13 or 14
        years old. As a result, our objective is to help kids get to
        that point equipped with the following: solid fundamentals, a strong work ethic, comfort in competition,and a love for the game.`,

      joining The Havoc team. If we feel like there are kids and
      families that align to our values and can help us be more
      competitive, they are added to the Havoc Team.`,

    communicate this framework to the kids and give them an initial
    idea of their current standing. We will then communicate to them
    that attitude, commitment, effort, and their skill level will
    constitute their general placement and that they can adjust
    their placement by focusing on these key factors. Group

        Saturday games we work hard to get quality playing time for all.

        rotation more than on Sundays.

      `
        Sunday games we adopt a more competitive approach. We bat the
        best 9 or 10 players and substitute less frequently, unless
        doing so enhances our competitiveness.

        When we are up or down by 10 runs or more we work hard to get
        all kids in the game and at bats.
      `,
      `
        Scrimmage or weekday game we try to split in half. The first
        half is used to get quality reps for the kids that will be
        playing in the upcoming tournament. The second half emphasizes
        development, so we emphasize position rotation and equitable
        playing time.

      `
        We emphasize position rotation in practice. Players will get
        reps at nearly all positions.

        Playing time is determined by things like skill,
        practice/season/game time performance, attitude, practice
        attendance, etc.

        Kids who don’t get to play as much, understand why through clear
        and direct communication and plans are offered to facilitate
        improvement.

        Kids who are not playing always have a role, and are always put
        in a position to learn and further develop their skills.
